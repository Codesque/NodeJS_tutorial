// MIDDLEWARE

// Middlewares are the functions that execute during the request to the server
// Each middleware func. has access to the request and response object

// Middleware functions execute some code that can have side effects on the app, and usually add information to the request or response
// objects.They are also capable of ending the cycle by sending a response when some condition is satisfied.
// If they donâ€™t send the response when they are done, they start the execution of the next function in the stack.
// This triggers calling the 3rd argument, next().

// Middleware functions take 2 arguments
// 1.path 
// 2.callback function that contains the request object, response object, and next() function to call the next middleware function 
// if the response of the current middleware is not terminated.In the second parameter, 
// we can also pass the function name of the middleware.
